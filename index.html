                     <p>Since I started coding I have become obsessed with it. I have always been curious on how different websites are created.<br> Hence I count myself lucky to be among the coding family. </p>

        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>My school level is upto form four.<br> I have also managed to do a bit of short certificate course like web design. I have a job experience on machine learning.<br> This I did for a period of six months. <br> I love drawing, reading and laughing. Growing up in slums I have always believed that no matter where you grew up, it is almost certain that, in some way, the community of friends and family around you contributed positively to your formative years. <br> This is why it is so important to return these favors, and to give back to those around, even in small ways.<br> By learning coding am sure that I will be able to come up with beautiful ideas that will change my community.<br> Below is a link of the few websites have managed to design since I joined Moringa School:</p>
